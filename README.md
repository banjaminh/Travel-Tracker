# Travel Tracker
## üìù Description
Travel Tracker is an application that organizes a users travel data and allows the booking of new travel plans. 

## Context
Travel Tracker is the final solo project from Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design.  It was completed over the course of one week.  


### User Experience Design Process: 

At the start of the project we combined several design inspirations and came up with a wireframe for our User-Interface.  

We did usability testing to learn more about what parts of our site were unclear to first-time users and revised the html and css to be more legible.  

### Use of Web APIs:  

We learned to implement 3rd party javascript libraries including chart.js and SortableJS. 

This project was our first chance to practice accessing and updating API datasets using GET and POST requests.  


## Learning Goals and Objectives
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.  
2. Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.  
3. Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity. 
4. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.  
5. Make network requests to retrieve data.
6. Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
7. Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility.
